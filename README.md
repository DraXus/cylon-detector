# cylon-detector
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/cylon-detector

This application takes a photo of a subject and performs an stochastic computational procedure to detect is he (or it) is a Cylon. (The Cylon characters are human-like robots that appear in Battlestar Galactica television series, btw).

The project is for Android 2.1-update1 or greater.

The zxing (Zebra Crossing) project has some work with frames from camera. We get some ideas and code from there.
